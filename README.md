Vrooom - A Monte Carlo raytracer

An implementation of a Monte Carlo ray tracer.
The rendering equation is split up in diffuse/specular och direct/indirect illumination to decrease convergence time.

An octree is used to efficiently check rays for intersections against objects.

A project for the course TNCG13 held at Link√∂ping University, 2013.
